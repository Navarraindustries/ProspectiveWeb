## Overview

PROSPECTIVE Web is a clinical decision-support system for neurosurgical planning
of cerebral aneurysms. A clinician uploads a DICOM study and walks a seven-step
pipeline, with every step rendered live in 3D:

```
1 DICOM upload  →  2 Segmentation  →  3 Detection  →  4 Morphometry
      →  5 Treatment decision  →  6 Devices  →  7 Report
```

All medical image processing runs on the server (VTK + SimpleITK); the browser
renders meshes with vtk.js and 2D slices as server-rendered PNGs.

Every step of that pipeline is **reversible**: the mesh carries an undo/redo
history, the preprocessing can be rolled back to the original DICOM, and the
detection, morphometry, centreline, treatment decision and placed devices can each
be cleared without restarting the study. Nothing derived from a result outlives
the result itself, so the 3D scene, the measurements and the PDF can never
disagree with one another.

Beyond the pipeline the platform covers the surrounding clinical workflow:
patient registry, clinical cases, a durable archive of imaging studies with a
searchable preview gallery, resumable planning sessions, user signup with admin
approval, and a tamper-evident audit chain.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** and **Node.js 20+**
- Windows / macOS / Linux (VTK and SimpleITK are cross-platform)

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JEsteban1999/ProspectiveWeb.git
cd ProspectiveWeb

# Backend
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\pip install -r requirements.txt      # Windows
# .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt        # macOS / Linux

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

Or, on Windows, with the Makefile from the repo root:

```bash
make install:backend
make install:frontend
```

---

## Running the App

Double-click **`start-all.bat`** (Windows) to launch both servers, or run them
separately:

```bash
# Backend — http://127.0.0.1:8000
cd backend && .venv\Scripts\uvicorn main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

# Frontend — http://localhost:5173
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

| URL | Description |
|---|---|
| `http://localhost:5173/` | Public landing page |
| `http://localhost:5173/app` | The application (login → patients → workspace) |
| `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` | Swagger UI |
| `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc` | ReDoc |
| `http://127.0.0.1:8000/health` | Health check |

Default account seeded on first run: **`admin` / `admin123`**. Change it from the
user menu ("Cambiar contraseña") before using the app with real data — an admin
can also reset another user's password from the Usuarios page.

> **Note on `--reload`**: uvicorn's reloader does not reliably pick up *new*
> modules, and a stale process on :8000 will silently serve old code. Restart the
> backend for real when verifying a change end to end.

---

## Environment Variables

The server runs out of the box with sensible defaults.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PROSPECTIVE_DB_URL` | `sqlite:///backend/data/prospective.db` | SQLAlchemy connection string |
| `JWT_SECRET` | auto-generated into `backend/secrets/jwt_secret.txt` | HS256 signing key |
| `SESSION_TTL_HOURS` | `24` | Age at which an idle working session is purged |
| `STUDY_FILES_ROOT` | `backend/study_files` | Root of the durable study archive |
| `STORAGE_BACKEND` | `local` | `local` (filesystem) or `s3` |
| `STORAGE_S3_BUCKET` | — | Required when `STORAGE_BACKEND=s3`; bucket must be private |
| `STORAGE_S3_PREFIX` | — | Optional key prefix inside the bucket |
| `COOKIE_SECURE` | off | Mark the auth cookie `Secure` (set it when serving over HTTPS) |
| `BACKEND_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8000` | Where the Vite dev server proxies `/api`, `/data`, `/static` |

Token lifetime is currently a constant (`ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MIN`, 24 h) in
`services/auth_service.py`, not an environment variable.

For production, always set `JWT_SECRET` from the deployment environment and never
commit it.

## Data Model

The clinical hierarchy is deliberately four levels deep, so one episode of care
can carry several acquisitions without duplicating records:

```
Patient  ──<  Study (clinical case)  ──<  ImagingStudy (one acquisition)
                      │                            │
                      └──────<  PlanningSession  >─┘
```

- **Patient** — demographics, history, institution.
- **Study** — the *clinical case*: diagnosis, aneurysm type, region, laterality,
  proposed treatment. Created via "Nuevo caso" against an existing patient.
- **ImagingStudy** — one archived acquisition (CT, angiography, follow-up) with
  its DICOM in durable storage plus a rendered preview. A case may hold several.
- **PlanningSession** — a saved run of the pipeline, linked to both the case and
  the acquisition it analysed, resumable from the step it was saved at.

The **Studies gallery** (the "Estudios" tab, and inside each patient sheet) lists
archived imaging studies as preview cards. The search runs **on the server**, so
it covers the whole archive — filtering only the page that happened to be loaded
made an older patient come back empty with nothing to explain why.

Each card shows the step its planning reached and offers two actions:
**«Reanudar»** restores the saved session at that step, and **«De cero»** starts a
fresh session at step 1 and says so. A card only offers to resume when the
snapshot is really on disk: sessions saved before durable saving existed, or
purged since, would otherwise fail on restore.

---

## Session Lifecycle

Every pipeline interaction is scoped to a **session** — a UUID directory:

```
backend/data/sessions/{uuid}/
├── .created_at          # ISO timestamp used for TTL cleanup
├── state.txt            # Key-value store (dicom.*, seg.*, morpho.*, treatment.*)
├── dicom/               # Uploaded DICOM files
├── meshes/              # Meshes (.vtp) + cached volume (_volume.npy)
│   ├── _undo/           # Mesh edit history + index.json manifest
│   └── _redo/           # States stepped back past, replayable
├── reports/             # Generated PDFs
└── exports/             # Exported STL files
```

Sessions are working scratch and are purged after `SESSION_TTL_HOURS`. Two
mechanisms make work survive that sweep:

- **Archiving a study** copies its DICOM into `study_files/` (or S3) and creates
  an `ImagingStudy`. This is what puts it in the gallery.
- **Saving progress** snapshots the session directory into
  `data/session_saves/{uuid}`. The DICOM is hard-linked rather than copied
  (studies are ~1 GB and copying them filled the disk); meshes and the volume
  cache are copied, because re-running a step rewrites them in place and a
  snapshot must stay a point-in-time image. The mesh undo/redo stacks are pruned
  out of the snapshot — they are a working convenience, and carrying every
  intermediate state multiplied the size of each save.

A restored session starts its own clock. `_clone_tree` copies every file in the
snapshot, `.created_at` included, so a session restored from a week-old save came
back already past the TTL and the next purge sweep deleted it mid-session, with
no message — any session older than `SESSION_TTL_HOURS` was effectively
unresumable. The live session is stamped with the time it was actually created.

What survives a save → restore, verified end to end: the segmentation and every
mesh edit, the detection, the morphometry *including the fitted neck plane and
the points marked around the rim*, the centreline, the treatment decision, the
placed devices (and so the report), and any made-to-order clip built for the
case. The marks matter as much as the measurement: the plane can be rebuilt from
its origin and normal, but a resumed session used to show that plane with
nothing behind it, and refining it meant marking the rim again from scratch.

Typical flow:

```
POST /api/upload                       → session_id + detected series
GET  /api/segment/suggested-band/{id}  → auto HU band for this modality
POST /api/segment                      → vessel_tree.vtp
POST /api/detect/{id}                  → aneurysm candidates
GET  /api/morphometry/{id}             → neck/dome measurements
POST /api/treatment-decision           → CLIP vs ENDO recommendation
POST /api/report                       → PDF assembled from session state
POST /api/studies/cases/{case}/archive → DICOM into durable storage
POST /api/sessions/save                → resumable snapshot + DB link
```

Session files are served statically under `/data/sessions/` so vtk.js can fetch
mesh URLs directly — behind a middleware that requires the same token as the API,
since those directories also hold the uploaded DICOM.

---

## Undoing Work

A planning session is exploratory: thresholds get retuned, a seed lands on the
wrong vessel, a case is evaluated with the wrong location. Every step therefore
has a way back that does not cost a re-upload or a re-segmentation.

| What | How to undo it | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| ROI crop · grow from seeds · re-segmentation | «Deshacer» — `POST /api/mesh-restore/{sid}` `scope=undo` | file copy |
| Every interactive mesh edit at once | «Restaurar malla original» — `scope=original` | file copy |
| An undo taken one step too far | «Rehacer» — `scope=redo` | file copy |
| HU clipping · resampling · smoothing · bone subtraction | «Revertir» — `DELETE /api/preprocess/{sid}` | rebuild from the session's DICOM |
| Candidates + morphometry + the neck plane | «Limpiar detección» — `DELETE /api/detect/{sid}` | instant |
| Neck or dome marker placed on the wrong spot | Clear that one marker in the morphometry panel | instant |
| The medial axis and any stent deployed along it | `DELETE /api/centerline/{sid}` | instant |
| The recommendation, its clinical context and PHASES | `DELETE /api/treatment-decision/{sid}` | instant |
| A placed clip, coil packing or stent | `DELETE /api/devices/{sid}?kind=…` | instant |
| A wrongly imported custom clip | `DELETE /api/clips/custom/{sid}/{index}` | instant |

Two rules keep the session honest while all of this happens:

- **Nothing derived outlives its source.** Restoring a mesh clears the candidates,
  morphometry and centreline measured on the old one; clearing the detection also
  clears the treatment recommendation and the PHASES score, because both are
  computed *from* the morphometry. Leaving them behind produced a PDF that
  recommended a treatment for an aneurysm the same PDF reported as unmeasured.
- **Generated outputs are cache-busted and dated.** A PDF, a DICOM SR and an STL
  are snapshots of the mesh, the measurements and the devices at the moment they
  were written. The filename is fixed per session, so the URLs carry a version
  token and the panel says when a download no longer matches what is on screen.

The mesh history lives inside the session directory, so a session that is saved
and resumed still offers «Deshacer» — the browser has no memory of edits it did
not make, and `GET /api/mesh-restore/{sid}` is what the panel asks on mount. The
same applies to the preprocessing (`GET /api/preprocess/{sid}`), the placed
devices (`GET /api/devices/{sid}`) and the imported clips
(`GET /api/clips/custom/{sid}`).

---

## Choosing a Clip

The devices step answers a specific question: **does anything we own fit this
aneurysm, and if not, what has to be made?**

### Two stages

1. **Analytic** — every clip in the catalogue is judged against the case,
   criterion by criterion. Each verdict carries the measurement that produced it,
   because "score 92.6" is not something a surgeon can check.

   | Criterion | What it compares |
   |---|---|
   | Cobertura | Blade length against the neck, with a safety margin |
   | Fenestración | Window calibre against the measured parent artery |
   | Alcance | Shape against dome depth (AR) |
   | Forma / localización | Shape against the anatomical region on the case |
   | Fuerza de cierre | Spring force against neck width |

2. **Geometric** — the best candidates are built at their real dimensions,
   posed on the measured neck plane and checked against the patient's own mesh.

   Two details make this mean anything. A clip across the neck necessarily
   intersects the vessel — *the neck is vessel* — so the sac and neck region are
   cut away first and the collision test runs against what remains; a hit then
   means the blade reaches a **neighbouring** structure. And several approach
   angles are tried: reporting only the best pose made a clip that clears its
   neighbours at every angle look identical to one that clears them at exactly
   one. Both numbers are reported (`clean_rolls` of `n_rolls`).

### Four outcomes, never an empty list

| Outcome | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `stock` | At least one clip meets every criterion |
| `marginal` | Usable clips exist, but all carry a caveat — the custom alternative is offered too |
| `manufacture` | Nothing fits; the answer is a specification to have one made |
| `unmeasured` | No reliable neck, so no selection is possible — mark the neck plane first |

The old recommender returned an empty list for a 1 mm neck and for a 20 mm neck
alike. An empty list *is* the answer "nothing made fits this patient"; it just
has to be delivered as a specification rather than as silence.

### The manufacturing specification

Blade length, width, height, spring, shape, angle, target closing force, and the
window diameter taken from the measured parent artery. Width, height and spring
follow the median proportions of the real catalogue rather than being invented —
but never below the smallest part that demonstrably exists. Scaling every
dimension with the blade treats a clip as one shape at different zooms, and a
2.5 mm neck then specified a 2.8 mm spring, 44 % under the shortest real one.
The spread of spring/blade across the catalogue (0.45–1.14) already says the
relation is not proportional, and the NAVARRO™ family settles it: 42 designs from
7 to 22 mm of jaw, all on the same 14.3 mm body. A spring is sized by the force
it holds, not by the blade in front of it. When a dimension is floored the spec
says so. `POST /api/clips/manufacture/{sid}` writes the STL.

**The STL comes from the drawn designs.** It used to come from the box builder —
348 triangles with 696 boundary edges for a 10 mm clip, an open surface that no
workshop or printer can take. Anything meant to be MADE is now built from the
NAVARRO™ family, which is watertight.

**A shape the family cannot build is never substituted in silence.** Available
shapes are read off the disk, so the curved and fenestrated series become
selectable by dropping their files in. Until then a fenestrated case is offered a
commercial clip of that shape — and if no commercial clip of that shape can close
the neck either, the answer is `unavailable` rather than a near-miss presented as
an alternative.

**Two dossiers.** The internal PDF records which patient, which case and which
measurements produced the dimensions, so the order can be re-derived a year
later. The workshop PDF carries no patient data by construction — dimensions,
tolerances, material and the checks to run on the finished part. They share a
part number, which is the only thread between them.

**Both dossiers show the piece.** Three renders of the very solid that goes
into the STL — superior, anterior and oblique — so a workshop can see the shape
it is quoting. A dimension table catches an order that is dimensionally wrong; a
picture catches one that is dimensionally right and shaped wrong. They carry no
patient data: they are pictures of a clip.

**The closing force is a target, never a result.** It comes from the spring, the
alloy and the heat treatment; an STL has no material. Both dossiers demand it be
measured on the finished part before anyone calls the order done.

The spec always lists what a machinist still has to confirm — a specification
that hides its assumptions is worse than one that states them. In particular,
**no parent-artery measurement means no window diameter**: the spec says so
instead of quietly falling back to a plain clip.

### The NAVARRO™ family (made to order)

`NAVARRO™ - Variantes/` holds the institution's own designs — 42 of them: T1
straight and T3 angled at 15/30/45/60/75/90°, each in 7/10/13/16/19/22 mm. They
are read straight off disk with no import step, so dropping the curved and
fenestrated series into the folder is all it takes to make them selectable.

Three things about them are easy to get wrong, and each is enforced in code:

- **Use the STL, never the OBJ.** The `.obj` exports are in CENTIMETRES (measured
  ratio 9.996–10.008 against the STL across all 41 pairs) *and* unwelded — the
  7 mm clip reads as 14 334 loose triangles with 43 002 boundary edges, a
  triangle soup that cannot be collision-tested. The `.stl` are already in
  millimetres and watertight. Nothing is rescaled.
- **The name states the JAW, not the clip.** A "7mm" NAVARRO grips 7 mm on a part
  21.30 mm long (`total = jaw + 14.30 mm`, constant across the family). Measuring
  the envelope and recording it as the blade makes the selector reject, as
  "oversized ×5.3", the very clip that fits a 4 mm neck. `add_clip` therefore
  accepts a declared `blade_length_mm` that overrides the measurement.
- **The closing force is a band, not a figure.** 120–200 g by design, not yet
  characterised. It travels as a band and the force criterion is capped at
  `warn` for these clips however well the band sits — "meets the criterion" is a
  claim nobody can make yet.

**Visibility.** Stock and made-to-order answer different questions — what can be
picked up today, and what would be made for this case — so the recommendation
always shows at least the best of each. Ranking alone hid the family: a design
whose closing force is still a band is capped at `warn` on that criterion, and
with a 6 mm neck 28 of the 42 designs were viable while the best ranked 12th of
60, so every visible slot went to stock. The scores are untouched; only
visibility changed.

**Resizing.** These are manufactured per case, so the jaw is not restricted to
the six drawn sizes: `POST /api/clips/navarro/{sid}` builds any jaw length, and
the panel both suggests the one the neck asks for and lets it be set by hand.
The stretch applies to the **jaw only, along its own axis** — the body and spring
are left exactly as drawn, because a uniform scale would resize the spring too
and its closing force would no longer be the family's. That is legitimate rather
than invented: sampling the jaw taper at ten stations and normalising by length,
the profiles agree to within ~0.05 mm across the drawn sizes, so the designs are
one shape stretched. Where the jaw *starts* is read off each mesh rather than
assumed — it is 2.50 mm at 0° and 90° but 3.95 mm at 15°, because the knee takes
up room. A stretched mesh is a faithful preview for display and collision
testing, **not** the manufacturing master.

### «Fabricación», a step of its own

Ordering a piece is not planning a case. Everything in **Dispositivos** answers
*what do I put in this patient, and where* — one sitting, all inside the session.
Ordering answers *how do I get the piece made*: it takes weeks, involves an
outside workshop, its register lives outside the session, and it stays alive
after the plan is closed, because the piece still has to arrive and be measured.

So it is step 7 of 8, between Dispositivos and Informe, and it is **optional** —
most cases are served by a catalogue clip and never go near it. The rail labels
it as such: a new step between two mandatory ones reads as mandatory unless
something says otherwise.

It took the manufacturing sheet (STL and dossiers) and the order workflow out of
the clips tab: **844 lines, more than a third of a step that held ~2,270.**

Two things that had to move with it. The step list was written out **four
times** — the workspace rail, the landing page, the patient sheet and the study
gallery — and sessions store the step they were saved at as an **integer**. With
four copies, inserting a step renumbers some views and not others; and every
session saved on «Informe» (index 6) would have resumed on «Fabricación». The
list now lives in `frontend/src/pipeline/steps.ts` alone, and a recorded
migration renumbers saved sessions once. Data migrations that are not idempotent
now register themselves in `applied_migrations` rather than relying on luck.

### Requesting a clip

`POST /api/clip-orders/{sid}` turns a recommendation into a real order. Most of
the form is already answered: the system knows the series, the bend, the jaw, the
tolerances and the force band, so the user is asked only what it cannot know —
who answers for the piece, how many, by when, and where it goes.

**Nothing measured is retyped.** The dangerous version of this screen is a blank
form where the surgeon re-enters the jaw length: the moment the typed number and
the STL can disagree, a workshop receives a dimension nobody derived. Changing a
computed figure is allowed — it is the surgeon's call — but it needs a reason,
and the reason is printed in our copy of the dossier next to what the system had
advised.

**A signed order is frozen.** The dimensions are copied into it, not looked up
when it is read. Re-running morphometry afterwards changes what the system would
advise today; it must not change what was ordered and sent.

**Two defects the register exposed and fixed.** The part number used to be
derived from the session and the jaw (`PR-{session}-{jaw×10}`), so two clips
ordered from one session with the same jaw and different bends got the *same*
number — on the only thread between our copy and the workshop's. And the files
had fixed names per session, so a second order overwrote the first one's STL and
dossiers. Orders now take a correlative `PR-YYYY-NNNN` and own a directory.

**Who signs.** `medico` and `admin` sign; a `residente` prepares the draft.
Signing needs a responsible surgeon, a workshop, and three declarations that the
UI may not pre-tick: the measurements are accepted, the closing force is a target
to be measured on the finished part, and the STL is geometry rather than an
approved device. When the intended use is *implant in a patient* the order also
records an authorisation reference — it does not block, it records.

**What leaves the building** is a ZIP with the STL and the workshop's dossier,
and nothing else: no patient name, no case, no session. A person downloads it and
sends it; the application mails nothing on its own.

**The order is not done until the piece is measured.** Reception demands the
measured jaw and the measured closing force — the only point at which the force
stops being a target — and a piece outside the jaw tolerance or the 120–200 g
band cannot be accepted in silence: either it is rejected, or someone states in
writing why the deviation is acceptable and that stays with the order.

**The register is a screen of its own** (`/app/pedidos`), outside the pipeline:
the pipeline walks ONE case, this crosses all of them and answers a management
question — what is ordered, and what is going stale. Reached from the top menu,
or from a patient's sheet, which opens it already filtered by that patient, so
one view serves both questions.

Two things separate it from a plain table. It **sorts by what is rotting**, not
by creation date: an order sent forty days ago with no news matters more than one
signed yesterday, and the thresholds follow the state — three weeks for a
workshop, one for a piece already in the building that nobody has accepted or
rejected. And it **surfaces pieces received out of specification**, which is
exactly what must not be buried in a list.

**Workshops are typed once.** A workshop entered in the form is saved and picked
from a list next time. Orders copy its details at signing, so correcting an
address later never rewrites where a past order was actually sent.

**Sterilisation and marking are stated assumptions, not policy.** Nobody has yet
confirmed how this institution handles either, so the order assumes the hospital
sterilises (a machine shop rarely delivers sterile, and titanium takes steam) and
that the part number is engraved on the **body** — never on the jaw, which is the
dimension measured against the neck, and never on the spring, where a mark
concentrates stress exactly where the closing force comes from. Both assumptions
are written into the two dossiers so the workshop can contradict them before
cutting metal.

### The clip library

`clip_library/` is a global, persistent store outside `data/`, holding two kinds
of entry: `stock` clips the institution actually owns (these join the built-in
catalogue when a case is scored) and `template` manufacturing designs (which
never compete as stock — a design nobody has made is not something to reach for
in theatre).

From an uploaded mesh the store measures the **oriented** bounding box and the
volume. Everything else is declared on import, and the reason is worth knowing
because it looks automatable:

- **Closing force** is a property of the spring and the alloy. No geometry
  carries it, so a `stock` clip without one is refused rather than stored with a
  zero that would silently sink it in every ranking.
- **Shape and fenestration** could in principle be inferred, but a CAD export is
  rarely a clean closed manifold and the inference fails quietly on exactly the
  irregular meshes where it would matter. `POST /api/clip-library/measure`
  offers a hint to pre-fill the form; it is labelled a suggestion.
- **Blade width and height** cannot be separated from the jaw opening by a
  bounding box — across that axis the envelope is two blades plus the gap — so
  the stored figures are named `envelope_*`.

### What this is not

The geometric criteria are arithmetic on measured quantities. The clinical
preferences (shape per region, closing-force windows) are heuristics from Lawton
2011, Molyneux and Pierot & Wakhloo, **not validated against annotated cases** —
there is no ground truth in this project to validate a ranking against. The panel
is assistive and always shows its reasons; it does not choose a clip.

Whether a branch actually runs through the neck is not visible in the isolated
sac mesh, so "consider a fenestrated clip" is raised once as a case-level
caveat, never as a defect on each non-fenestrated clip. A warning that fires on
almost the whole catalogue stops carrying information.

## Navigation & Unsaved Work

The frontend uses a **data router** (`createBrowserRouter`), and the URL is the
source of truth for which screen is showing — Back/Forward, a refresh and a
shared link all land where the user expects, instead of resetting to the patient
list.

That matters because saving is manual. Leaving the pipeline throws the working
session away, so an accidental click on the logo — or a press of the browser's
Back button — used to cost an entire analysis without a word. The workspace now
marks itself dirty as soon as a step produces a result worth keeping, and:

- `useBlocker` intercepts **every** router navigation, including Back/Forward,
  and raises a confirmation dialog. A hand-rolled guard around the app's own
  click handlers could never see the browser's buttons.
- `beforeunload` covers closing the tab or reloading.
- Resuming a saved session marks it clean again. Rehydration replays the saved
  results through the same setters a real edit uses, so without this a resumed
  session asked to confirm before the user had touched anything.

The dirty flag is set inside the store's setters rather than at each call site,
so a panel added later cannot forget to do it.

## API Reference

94 operations under `/api`. Full spec in `openapi.json` or at `/docs`.

**Everything except `POST /api/auth/login`, `/signup` and `/logout` requires a
token.** It travels as `Authorization: Bearer …` or as the `prospective_token`
cookie that login also sets — the browser cannot attach a header to an `<img
src>` or to the requests vtk.js makes for `.vtp` meshes, and those URLs serve
patient imaging.

**Where the clip sits.** `pose_transform` puts a device's LOCAL ORIGIN on the
neck, and the synthetic catalogue clips are drawn with the jaw straddling that
origin. The NAVARRO origin is not in the jaw at all — for the drawn 7 mm straight
the jaw runs −9.50..−2.50 mm while the 14.30 mm body runs to +11.80 mm — so the
neck landed at the HINGE, with the whole jaw hanging off to one side and the body
crossing the aneurysm. `to_device_frame` now also shifts each design by
`jaw_root + jaw/2`, putting the middle of the useful grip on the origin, which is
where the neck belongs. The shift is measured off the mesh rather than assumed,
so it follows the bend: the knee at 15° pushes the root from 2.50 mm to 3.95 mm.

**The report shows the plan in 3D, from fixed viewpoints.** Four server-rendered
views — anterior, left, superior and oblique — of the segmented vasculature
(translucent grey), the sac (blue) and whatever devices are placed (gold clip,
violet coils, light-blue stent), so the clip is visible sitting on the neck.

They replace a single browser screenshot taken from wherever the camera happened
to be: two reports of the same case are now comparable against each other and
against a follow-up, and a report generated from a resumed session or a script
has pictures at all. The camera frames the sac **and** the devices together — the
first version framed the sac alone and cropped the clip, which is several times
larger than the aneurysm it closes. Rendering is best effort: a viewpoint that
fails is dropped and the report still goes out.

They are rendered at twice the requested size and averaged down. The offscreen
window runs with MSAA off — some drivers fail outright with it on — so without
that every edge was a hard staircase, which a PDF viewer smears into a blur.

A report generated BEFORE a device is placed shows four pictures of bare anatomy
and reads as a plan with no device in it. It now says so under the images, with
the remedy: place the device and generate the report again.

They are diagrams of the segmentation, not radiological images, and the caption
under them says so.

## Running Tests

```bash
cd backend
.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest -q                        # all 650 tests
.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest test_session_abc.py -v    # one suite
```

Expected: **650 passed, 0 failed** (~3–4 min; VTK and SimpleITK do real work).

Frontend checks:

```bash
cd frontend
npx vitest run          # 115 unit tests (vitest + Testing Library, jsdom)
npx tsc -b --noEmit     # type check
npm run build           # production build
```

Test isolation notes:

- Suites that touch the database point `PROSPECTIVE_DB_URL` at a temp SQLite file.
- Suites that touch the study archive **must** set `STUDY_FILES_ROOT` to a temp
  directory. The archive root is resolved per call precisely so this works; a
  frozen module constant once let the suite overwrite a real patient's DICOM.
  `test_study_gallery.py` asserts the isolation holds for the live app too.

## Relationship to the Desktop App

The **Prospective** desktop application (PyQt5/VTK) and this web app share the
same algorithms: every module under `prospective/processing`, `prospective/io`,
`prospective/dicom`, `prospective/audit` and `prospective/auth` has a Qt-free
counterpart under `backend/services`, and every desktop panel has a web panel.

| | Desktop (Prospective) | Web (ProspectiveWeb) |
|---|---|---|
| UI | PyQt5 widgets | React 19 + vtk.js in the browser |
| Processing | `processing/` (Qt-coupled) | `services/` (Qt-free, same algorithms) |
| Auth | local SQLite + signup approval | JWT + SQLite, same approval flow |
| Password change / reset | yes | yes (self-service + admin reset, audited) |
| Session persistence | `.prospective` file on disk | DB record + durable server-side snapshot |
| Undo a mesh edit | no | labelled undo/redo history, survives save + resume |
| Revert the preprocessing | no | rebuilt from the session's DICOM, no re-upload |
| Clear a step's result | no | detection, morphometry, centreline, decision and devices |
| Unsaved-work guard | n/a (autosaves to file) | confirmation on navigation, Back and tab close |
| Study archive & gallery | no | local or S3, with preview thumbnails |
| Case ↔ imaging separation | one study per case | several acquisitions per clinical case |
| Live HU threshold preview | no | tinted MPR overlay while dragging sliders |
| Series selector | no | picks among all series in a study |
| Standard 3D viewpoints | no | axial/coronal/sagittal ± opposite, plus refit |
| Clip recommendation | score from neck + AR | per-criterion, verified against the patient's mesh |
| No clip fits the case | empty list | specification to manufacture, with STL |
| Institutional clip inventory | no | global library, scored alongside the built-in catalogue |
| Multiple devices on screen | last one placed | every placed device at once, colour-coded with a legend |
| Public landing page | no | yes |
| Access | local machine | browser / any HTTP client |

## Known Limitations

An honest list of what is *not* done, so nobody discovers it in front of a
clinician.

**Functional**

- **`GET /api/thresholds/{sid}` is not used by the bundled frontend.** It returns
  the strategy key and a clinical hint; the UI reads the slider range from
  `GET /api/segment/suggested-band/{sid}` instead. Both share the same
  `compute_auto_thresholds` core, so they cannot drift apart.
- **No progress streaming.** Long operations show an indeterminate bar. A
  WebSocket route used to exist but emitted a canned sequence unrelated to real
  work and no client connected to it, so it was removed rather than left to look
  like a feature.
- **CSRF relies on `SameSite=Lax`.** The auth cookie is not sent on cross-site
  requests, and the API only accepts JSON, but there is no anti-CSRF token. Add
  one before serving the app from a domain that also hosts untrusted content.

**Clinical accuracy** (needs annotated ground truth, not a patch)

- Fully automatic aneurysm isolation is not viable on dense vascular trees; the
  reliable path is the two-click neck plane, which the UI guides you through.
- Bone and contrast overlap in HU, so no global threshold separates them on some
  studies. That is why the live threshold preview, seeded region-grow and ROI crop
  exist.
- The detector is unstable on sparse meshes and CT can saturate the candidate list
  with bone false positives; candidates are ranked and labelled with confidence so
  a low-confidence pick is visible.

---

## Privacy & Security Notes

This software handles identifiable patient data.

**How access control works**

- Every route requires a valid token except `POST /api/auth/login`, `/signup` and
  `/logout`. This is enforced at `include_router` time in `main.py` rather than
  per endpoint, so a router added without a guard is closed by default.
  `test_auth_coverage.py` walks the real route table and fails if anything
  outside an explicit allowlist answers anonymously.
- Beware `get_current_user`: it is an alias of `get_optional_user` and returns
  `None` instead of raising. Only `require_user` / `require_admin` authenticate.
- Login issues the token twice: as a bearer token for the API client and as an
  HttpOnly `SameSite=Lax` cookie, because `<img src>` (MPR slices) and vtk.js
  mesh requests cannot carry a header. Logging out clears the cookie server-side.
- `backend/data/` is a StaticFiles mount, so router dependencies do not apply to
  it. A middleware guards `/data/` with the same token check — session DICOM used
  to be downloadable by anyone who knew a session UUID.

**Before deploying**

- **Set `JWT_SECRET` from the environment.** Otherwise it is generated into
  `backend/secrets/jwt_secret.txt`. Never place it under `data/`: it lived there
  once and `GET /data/jwt_secret.txt` returned the signing key, which is enough to
  mint an admin token.
- **Change the seeded `admin` password** from the user menu ("Cambiar contraseña").
- Serve over HTTPS and set `COOKIE_SECURE=1` so the auth cookie is marked secure.
- Private material belongs in `study_files/` (archived DICOM), `user_files/`
  (signup photos and CVs), `clip_library/` (institutional clip geometry) and
  `secrets/` — all outside `data/` and gitignored.
- **Never run `git add -A` in this repository.** Real DICOM files have no extension
  (`IM_0001`, bare UIDs); the ignore rules cover the known folders, but stage
  explicit paths and check `git diff --cached --name-only` first.
- **S3 archive**: the bucket must be private and encrypted at rest; objects are
  handed out only as short-lived presigned URLs. Get legal sign-off before
  uploading identifiable patient imaging to a cloud provider.
