"""Pytest bootstrap — isolate the test database from the dev database.

Previously every test module called ``Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)`` on
the shared ``data/prospective.db``, so running the suite wrote hundreds of test
patients/sessions into the real dev database. Here we point the ORM at a throwaway
SQLite file *before* ``services.database`` is imported, then create the schema and
seed the default admin the tests rely on.
