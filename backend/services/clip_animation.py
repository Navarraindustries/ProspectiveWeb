"""Clip application as motion: approach the neck, open, close on it.

A placed clip is shown as a finished fact — geometry already sitting on the
neck. Rehearsing the manoeuvre needs the three moments that matter: coming down
the approach corridor with the jaw open, arriving astride the neck, and closing.
This module produces the pieces a viewer needs to play that.

What is derived and what is assumed
-----------------------------------
**Derived from the mesh**, so it holds for any clip and cannot drift from a
constant written here:

- the jaw-opening axis — the one axis with a clean empty corridor down the
  middle of the blades;
- the hinge — the coordinate along the clip where that corridor starts, i.e.
  where the two blades stop being two things;
- which way the jaw points from the hinge.

Measured this way the NAVARRO™ hinge lands at the same place in all six sizes,
which is what a real family does.

**Specified** by the NAVARRO™ designer: the tips never part by more than 10 mm,
because the applier limits the travel. Above that the opening is not a guess at
all. Below it — a short clip that never reaches the ceiling — how far it opens
is still inferred from how commercial clips behave, and `opening_is_specified`
says which case a given clip falls into.

What this is not
----------------
A visualisation of the intended placement, not a simulation. No tissue yields,
no applier is modelled, and nothing here says whether the corridor can actually
be reached with human hands. It shows, in motion, the placement the rest of the
pipeline computed.
