"""Second-stage clip check: place the candidate on the real neck and measure it.

`clip_selection` judges a clip by arithmetic on the morphometry — blade against
neck, force against neck, shape against region. That is fast enough to run over
the whole catalogue, but it never looks at the patient's actual vessel. Two
clips with identical blade length occupy very different space if one is a
bayonet, and only geometry can tell whether the far end of the blade runs into
the branch next door.

So the top few analytic candidates come here and get built at their real
dimensions (`devices.make_clip_shaped`), posed on the measured neck plane, and
measured.

What "collision" means here
---------------------------
A clip placed across the neck necessarily intersects the vessel surface — the
neck IS vessel. Testing the clip against the whole tree therefore reports a
collision for every clip, which is worse than useless: it looks like a safety
check and answers nothing.

The question worth asking is whether the clip hits something *beyond* the
target. So the vessel is first cut with a sphere around the neck, removing the
sac and the immediate neck region, and the collision test runs against what
remains. A hit then means the blade reaches into a neighbouring structure,
which is a genuine reason to prefer another clip.

The blade is still an approximation of a machined clip (no fillets, no real
spring), so a contact count is evidence, not a verdict.
