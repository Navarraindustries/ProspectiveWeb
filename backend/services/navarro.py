"""The NAVARRO™ clip family — the institution's own made-to-order designs.

These are not catalogue clips anyone stocks: they are parametric designs meant to
be manufactured for the case at hand. That changes two things about how the rest
of the system must treat them, and both are encoded here rather than left to the
caller to remember.

What the files are
------------------
`NAVARRO™ - Variantes/` holds each variant twice, and only one export is usable:

- **`.obj` — unusable.** Written in CENTIMETRES (measured ratio 9.996–10.008
  against the STL across all 41 pairs) and, worse, exported without welding
  vertices: the 7 mm clip reads as 14 334 loose triangles with 43 002 boundary
  edges. It is a triangle soup, not a solid, so it cannot be collision-tested.
- **`.stl` — the real thing.** Already in MILLIMETRES, watertight, one piece
  (0 boundary edges, 107.1 mm³ at 7 mm to 186.1 mm³ at 22 mm). No rescaling.

Geometry, measured rather than assumed
--------------------------------------
Every variant shares one body (the spring and the applier grip):

    body envelope   X[-1.80, 1.80]  Y[-4.81, 4.81]  Z[-11.80, 2.50]

and the jaw grows along the axis (sin θ, 0, cos θ), where θ is the angle in the
file name. `total length = jaw + 14.30 mm` holds exactly across the straight
sizes. Where the jaw *starts* along that axis is not a single constant — 2.50 mm
at 0° and 90°, up to 3.95 mm at 15°, because the knee occupies room — so it is
read off each mesh (`jaw_root_offset`) rather than assumed.

The name states the JAW, not the clip: "7mm" is 7 mm of useful grip, on a clip
21.30 mm long overall. That distinction is the whole reason this module exists —
measuring the bounding box and calling it the blade would record 21.30 mm for a
clip that grips 7 mm, and the selector would reject the very clip that fits.

Why resizing the jaw is legitimate
----------------------------------
The jaw tapers (≈4.3 mm at the root to ≈1.7 mm at the tip). Sampling the taper
at ten stations along each size and normalising by jaw length, the profiles agree
to within ~0.05 mm across the 10/13/16/19/22 mm sizes — the designs are the same
shape stretched, not six separately drawn parts. So scaling the jaw region along
its own axis reproduces the family's own design language instead of inventing a
shape. `resize_jaw` does exactly that, and nothing else: the body, the spring and
every cross-section perpendicular to the jaw axis are untouched, which is what
keeps whatever closing force the spring ends up having.

A stretched mesh is a faithful preview for display and collision testing. It is
NOT the manufacturing master — that comes from the parametric CAD, and
`resize_jaw` says so in what it returns.

    Two separate disagreements with the app's convention, and both placed the
    clip wrong.

    **Orientation.** `pose_transform` aligns a device's local +Z to the neck
    normal, and `make_clip_shaped` is drawn for that: blade length along +X, jaw
    opening along +Y, blade DEPTH along +Z, so the blade lies in the neck plane
    and spans it — which is what clipping a neck means. The NAVARRO exports use
    +Z for the clip's long axis instead, so posed as-is the jaw pointed straight
    up the neck normal, into the dome: the 10 mm clip reached +12.5 mm along the
    normal while the synthetic Yasargil of the same size stayed within ±0.5 mm.
    A -90° turn about Y reconciles them — the file's X (blade depth, ±1.80 mm)
    becomes +Z, its Z (the jaw axis) lies in the plane, its Y (the jaw opening)
    stays in the plane.

    **Origin.** Rotating was not enough. `pose_transform` puts the mesh's LOCAL
    ORIGIN on the neck, and the synthetic clips are drawn with the jaw straddling
    that origin (a 7 mm blade spans -3.75..+3.54 mm). The NAVARRO origin is not
    in the jaw at all: for the 7 mm straight design the jaw runs -9.50..-2.50 mm
    and the 14.30 mm body runs the other way to +11.80 mm. So the neck landed at
    the HINGE, with the whole jaw hanging off to one side and the body crossing
    the aneurysm — visible on screen as a clip whose blades never meet the neck
    they are supposed to close.

    Shifting by `jaw_root + jaw/2` along the jaw axis puts the MIDDLE OF THE
    USEFUL GRIP on the origin, which is where the neck belongs: the blades then
    close on the neck with half the grip either side. The shift is measured off
    this mesh (`jaw_root_offset`) rather than assumed, so a redrawn CAD cannot
    silently invalidate it, and it follows the bend — the knee at 15° pushes the
    root from 2.50 mm to 3.95 mm.
