/* Navigation context — lets any component (e.g. the Topbar) change the active
   screen without prop-drilling.

   Every screen has a URL under /app. Before this the active screen lived in a
   `useState`, so the browser's Back button walked out of the application
   entirely, a refresh always landed on the patient list, and there was no link
   to send a colleague. The Router keeps `screen` and the location in sync. */
